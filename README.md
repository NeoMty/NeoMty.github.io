## Why This Portfolio?
There are thousand of examples of how to create a portfolio. However, when I first saw this project, I knew this was the perfect one for me. 😁

>Why? -You may asked

You already know the answer. 😏

No, seriously. You already know. Look at the start of this README, look at my portfolio, you may notice that some inspiration was found on certain franchise. Unless, of course, you are a seaweed brain. 

In that case, welcome to my portfolio, Percy Jackson! 🔱 

Please keep in mind that I'm not responsible if a new quest is assigned to you while you're in here. And, if you're being followed (of course you're being followed 🙄), I would appreciate if you can keep any titans and monsters away from my place, thank you.

And if you already destroyed my place... dude, **seriously?**

Just for one time you can't destroy or break in another person's property? Can't you... you know, *just knock?* 🙄

>This time you will pay

And no, I don't accept any kind of magic to cleanse water that gave you daddy dearest or drachmas. I mean actual money, Jackson! 😒 

## Easter Eggs

I'm a Leo. 😎

>I'm a Leo. You're a Percy. -Leo Valdez

On a more serious note, I chose this portfolio because it has many elements of Percy Jackson ringed to it. 😁

Here are some easter eggs you can find:

- My cabin from Camp Half-Blood. I like to think of it as Athena's Cabin considering we all share the same fear.
- Festus, the dragon. I'm a Leo.
- Annabeth dad's airplane (I know is not the same one)
- Fox from Contact page. I like to think of him as Frank Zhang transformed. Of course the Mist could be hiding his true form. 🤔

Anyway, feel free to explore my portfolio and leave any suggestions. *Vaya con queso!* 😁💬
